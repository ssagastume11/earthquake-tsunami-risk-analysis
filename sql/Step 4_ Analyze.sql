-- Objective:
-- This goal of this step is to explore and analyze the cleaned earthquake dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between earthquake characteristics and tsunami occurrences from 2001-2022.

-- This includes examing how magnitude, depth, and location influence the likelihood of tsunamis and identifying regions with higher seismic activity or risk.

-- Key Actions:
-- * Calculating yearly and monthly trends in earthquake frequency and magnitude.
-- * Identifying correlations between magnitude, depth, and tsunami classification.
-- * Analyzing geographic patterns of earthquakes and tsunami-related events.
-- * Preparing summary statistics for visualization and interpretation.
