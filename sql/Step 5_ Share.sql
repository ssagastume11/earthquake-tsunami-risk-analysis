-- Objective:
-- The goal of this step is to visualize and communicate insights from the earthquake-tsunami dataset.
-- This includes indentifying yearly patterns, magnitude-depth relationships, and how tsunami classifications vary across time.

-- Key Actions:
-- * Use BigQuery charts or export to Tableau for trend visualization,
-- * Plot yearly average magnitude and depth trends.
-- * Highlight the frequency of tsunamis versus non-tsunamis per year.
