-- Objective:
-- The goal of this step is to process and transform the cleaned earthquake-tsunami dataset to prepare for meaningful analysis and visualizations.
-- This includes creating calculating fields, filtering data by revelant criteria, and deriving new insights such as average magnitudes, event frequencies and tsunami occurrence patterns across year and regions.

-- Key Actions:
-- * Filtering out low-magnitude (below 6.5) to focus on sighnificant seismic events.
-- * Creating new calculated fields to capture relationships between magnitude, depth, and tsunami occurrence.
-- * Summarizing data by year, month, and location to identify temporal and geigraphic trends.
-- * Aggregating statistics such as mean magnitude, total number of tsunami-related events, and percentage of tsunami occurrences.
-- * Ensuring processed data maintains integrity for accurate risk analysis and visualizations in later steps.
